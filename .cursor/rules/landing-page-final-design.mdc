# Landing Page Final Design & Implementation

This document summarizes the final state of the landing page, ensuring future edits align with the established design language.

## Overview

The primary landing page is located at [src/app/(public)/page.tsx](mdc:src/app/(public)/page.tsx). It is a pixel-perfect implementation of the "SaaSwiftie" reference design and is self-contained within that single file.

## Key Architectural and Design Decisions

-   **Framework**: The page is built using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS only. All styles are applied directly in the JSX using Tailwind classes.
-   **File Structure**: All code for the landing page—including components, logic, and styles—is consolidated into [src/app/(public)/page.tsx](mdc:src/app/(public)/page.tsx).

## Visual & Atmospheric Details

-   **Background**: The page uses a multi-layered background to create depth.
    -   A very faint, dotted "net" pattern (`radial-gradient`) provides subtle texture.
    -   A large, soft radial glow (`radial-gradient(circle_at_center,...)`) gives the page a modern, focused feel.
    -   The main content wrapper has a slightly transparent background (`bg-white/95`) to allow the texture to show through.
-   **Navbar**: The header uses a **three-zone flexbox layout** to keep the central navigation links perfectly centered, with the logo on the left and the primary CTA on the right.
-   **Shadows & Borders**: All cards and elevated elements are **borderless** and use soft, diffused shadows (e.g., `shadow-xl shadow-gray-200/50`) for a premium, clean aesthetic.

## Component-Specific Implementation

-   **Hero Image**: The main dashboard image features a **scroll-based animation**. It starts with a 10-degree 3D perspective tilt (`rotateX(10deg)`) and smoothly animates to be completely flat as the user scrolls down the first 500px of the page.
-   **"Built to Convert" Cards**: These four feature cards are not placeholders. They contain high-fidelity UI mockups built directly with styled `divs` to precisely match the reference design.
-   **"Clear, Not Confusing" Pills**: The colored pills in this section are styled with CSS gradients (`bg-gradient-to-br`) and shadows to give them a glossy, 3D, tactile appearance.
